I'm a natural born geek.  I wrote my first computer program for an Apple ][e, but not actually having one, I wrote it on paper and debugged it in my head.

Professionally, I got my start in the Navy where I spent 8 years as an Electronics Tech.  I still occasionally like to play with various hardware projects.  One of these days I'll get back to my Omnikey 102 mod/restoration.

In school my focus was primarily on theoretical computer science and mathematics.  Computer graphics has always appealed to me as an interesting intersection of programming and math.  You can check out some of my [toys](https://apps.stupid-genius.com/ProcessingJSLab/).  Type `help` to get started.

I've been a professional software engineer since 2013.  I got my start in ad tech working on a hierarchical targeting forecast engine.

I'm a tinkerer and a lover of puzzles.  I like troubleshooting and figuring things out.  I enjoy getting out on my bike and enjoying Colorado, and then coming home and cooking dinner or playing my guitar.  I'm eagerly awaiting my Steam Deck and my Analogue Pocket.
